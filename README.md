# Machine Learning the 6d SUGRA Landscape

Machine Learning has been a useful tool for analysing large, and often complex, sets of data. They can reveal patterns hidden within the data providing a deeper level of understanding and information about the data. In [[2503.xxxxx](arxiv.com/hep-th/)] we initiate this approach on the set of admissable and anomaly-free 6-dimensional supergravity models with 8 supercharges [add ref].

## Access to Results
Our results from the autoencoder can all be found in the companion GitHub page [Machine Learning the 6d SUGRA Landscape](). To aid with navigation we provide a clickable image with links to the associated clusters as well as a "Comparison View" tool where separate clusters and/or multiple instances of the same cluster can be viewed one a single webpage side-by-side.
