# Models
The Autoencoder and Classifier models trained on the set of anomaly coefficients, in the form of Gram matrices. Each folder above contains one model saved in three formats (i.e. keras, hdf5, and saved_model). According to the TensorFlow developers, .keras is the recommended format, however, we provide all three formats for convenience so please download whichever version of the model you prefer. It is not necessary to download more than one version of the model.
